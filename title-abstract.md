### Toric degenerations and Newton-Okounkov bodies arising from cluster algebras
Abstract: A toric degeneration is a flat degeneration of a projective variety to a toric variety, which can be used to apply the theory of toric varieties to other projective varieties. The theory of cluster algebras is useful to construct toric degenerations. Indeed, introducing the notion of positive polytopes, Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich [GHKK] gave a general framework to construct toric degenerations of compactified A-cluster varieties.

A different approach is given by the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies. A Newton-Okounkov body is a convex body constructed from a projective variety with an ample line bundle and with a higher rank valuation on the function field, which gives a systematic method of constructing toric degenerations of projective varieties. The notions of g-vectors and c-vectors in cluster algebras induce higher rank valuations, and we can systematically construct Newton-Okounkov bodies of compactified A-cluster varieties [FO] and of compactified X-cluster varieties [RW, BCMNC].

In this lecture series, we study Newton-Okounkov bodies arising from cluster structures and discuss their relation with Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich's positive polytopes, following Bossinger-Cheung-Magee-N\'{a}jera Ch\'{a}vez [BCMNC] and my joint work [FO] with Hironori Oya.

### Title: Cluster $K_2$-structure on the moduli space of decorated twisted $G$-local systems
Abstract: The moduli space $\mathcal{A}_{G,\Sigma}$ of decorated twisted $G$-local systems on a marked surface $\Sigma$ has been introduced by Fock—Goncharov (2006). It admits a natural cluster $K_2$-structure: explicit cluster charts are given by Fock—Goncharov (2006) for type $A_n$; by Le (2019) for all classical types and $G_2$; and finally by Goncharov—Shen (2019 preprint) for general types, unifying the previous type-by-type constructions.  
In this talk, I will review the construction of cluster charts following Goncharov—Shen. Time permitting, I will mention my joint work with Hironori Oya and Linhui Shen that shows $\mathscr{A}=\mathscr{U}$ for the cluster algebras arising from these moduli spaces and reveals their relation to the braid varieties.
