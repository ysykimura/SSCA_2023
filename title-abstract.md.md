### Title: Cluster $K_2$-structure on the moduli space of decorated twisted $G$-local systems
Abstract: The moduli space $\mathcal{A}_{G,\Sigma}$ of decorated twisted $G$-local systems on a marked surface $\Sigma$ has been introduced by Fock—Goncharov (2006). It admits a natural cluster $K_2$-structure: explicit cluster charts are given by Fock—Goncharov (2006) for type $A_n$; by Le (2019) for all classical types and $G_2$; and finally by Goncharov—Shen (2019 preprint) for general types, unifying the previous type-by-type constructions.  
In this talk, I will review the construction of cluster charts following Goncharov—Shen. Time permitting, I will mention my joint work with Hironori Oya and Linhui Shen that shows $\mathscr{A}=\mathscr{U}$ for the cluster algebras arising from these moduli spaces and reveals their relation to the braid varieties.
